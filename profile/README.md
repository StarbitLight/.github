# Welcome to the Starbit Light team! ðŸŒ 

Founded in 2020, Starbit Light is a team created by Raphael composed of a few members around the world working on their free time. Our goal is to bring fun and entertainment to your universe!

## A new way to play
We develop games using various game engines. The optimization is our top priority while working on something, we are making sure everyone is getting a smooth experience while using our creations.

To make sure everyone is satisfied with our work, we are always listening to all the players feedback through our socials. We hope to create as many projects as possible, and we're looking forward to see how players will enjoy them!

As of now, our biggest project Suicide For Him is currently in Early Access on Steam (Windows only). We hope to extend the compatibility of the game to many other platforms whenever all the content is implemented. Beside Suicide For Him, we are working on other games, proper announcements will be done whenever they're ready to release.
